# Svelte Electron App

This is a project template for Electron App with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) Framework

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit DEVLOPRR/svelte-electron-template svelte-electron-app
cd svelte-electron-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-electron-app
npm install
```

...then start the Application:

```bash
npm start
```

And your electron window will open in few seconds (depending on your computer)

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building

To create an executable version of your app:

```bash
npm run forge-package
```

You can run your app by locating the executable file inside `out`

## Packaging and running in production mode
